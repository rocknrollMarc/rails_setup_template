= Requirements

1. A UNIX-based system.
2. {Ruby 1.9.x}[http://www.ruby-lang.org].
3. {Ruby on Rails 3.2.x+}[http://rubyonrails.org].
4. A solid internet connection.

= Usage

Open a terminal window and execute one the following command lines depending on your version preference:

Current Version (stable):

  rails new demo -d sqlite3 -J -T -f --skip-bundle -m https://raw.github.com/bkuhlmann/rails_setup_template/v4.6.0/template.rb

Master Version (unstable):

  rails new demo -d sqlite3 -J -T -f --skip-bundle -m https://raw.github.com/bkuhlmann/rails_setup_template/master/template.rb

Here is what each option is doing and why:

* -d - Specifies the SQLite3 database for quick and easy setup.
* -J - Skips adding any JavaScript libraries since jQuery UJS support is provided by the Resourcer gem.
* -T - Skips setting up Test::Unit files since RSpec is what we want.
* -f - Forces overwrite of any existing files so the template is not interrupted during setup.
* --skip-bundle - Skips running "bundle install" since the template does this for you at appropriate time of setup.

*TIP*: You can reduce unnecessary typing with new app generation by adding the new rails options, listed above,
to your .railsrc file. Any options in the .railsrc file will be applied with each new app generation.

= Setup

After the template has been applied, you'll want to tweak the following files:

* config/deploy.rb = Switch the _example_ placeholders with your server specific info.
* config/initializers/system.rb = Replace with your own info.
* public/apple-touch-icon-114x114.png = Replace with your own custom image.
* public/apple-touch-icon.png = Replace with your own custom image.
* public/favicon.ico = Replace with your own custom icon.
* public/humans.txt = Replace with your own info.

= Capistrano

This project comes equiped with several Capistrano recipes (see config/recipes directory). Make sure to configure
the deploy.rb file as you see fit (as mentioned above). You might want to configure the recipes and templates (see
config/recipes/templates) as well. Once configured, you can perform the following commands to setup a remote server
from scratch, deploy, and launch your rails app. Here are the commands for doing this:

* cap deploy:install
* cap <environment> deploy:setup
* cap <environment> deploy:cold
* cap <environment> deploy

NOTE: These scripts are configured to support multiple environments so make sure to replace the <environment> with
the environment you are working in. For example, I like to use _stage_ and _production_ environments.
